# BigData_Scala_Cat_Dog_Duck
This project is an attempt at developing an object detection model using modern computer vision technology. The project aims to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques for object detection with the goal of achieving high accuracy in detecting objects. The model is build using the MXNet Scala Inference API or Tensorflow for scala.
